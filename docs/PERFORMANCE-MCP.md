# Required performance MCP workflow

Also required: use **topdown-profiler** for experiment assessment and include the
four-category TMA classification in every experiment report.
[TMA reporting and provenance](TMA-REPORTING.md) defines the required format.

The user requires the performance MCP from
[CPU Performance Engineering](https://github.com/usamahz/cpu-performance-engineering)
in **every investigation or optimization work session**, for **both Codex and Claude**.
This applies to the controller and worker sessions, including resumed sessions and
worktrees. Read this alongside AGENTS.md at startup. A worker may consume a shared
consultation, but must identify it as shared evidence and record its own availability
check; it must not claim another agent's calls as its own.

## Required session steps

1. Discover and connect to the project's `cpu-perf` MCP server. Check `library_status`
   to identify the served repository/library version, coverage and unavailable sources.
2. Call `ask` before choosing an optimization hypothesis or interpreting performance.
   Include the actual architecture, workload, source/build identity and available
   measurements or assembly in `context`. Ask a concrete question tied to the current
   investigation; a generic lookup alone does not satisfy this step.
3. Follow relevant evidence with `lookup`, `get_section`, `get_entry` or `read_source`.
   Use `check_evidence` when assessing a performance claim. Cite a source only when
   the retrieved passage actually supports the statement; unread sources are leads.
4. Record a consultation in the experiment or session activity log: UTC time, actual
   agent/backend, server/version or revision when available, tool names and inputs,
   concise findings, supporting source URLs, coverage limits, and what changed—or
   why the advice did not change the plan. Unknown metadata stays unknown.
5. Reconsult when a materially new hotspot, surprising result or proposed mechanism
   appears. Use the MCP's evidence to challenge the explanation before implementation.

## Availability and measurement discipline

If the server is unavailable, attempt discovery/connection and record the exact
failure and any remediation. Consult the linked primary sources as an explicitly
labelled fallback while continuing independent authorized work. Retry when the tool
becomes available; never silently skip the requirement or fabricate a tool response.
A compatible local stdio MCP client is acceptable when the host does not expose the
server directly; record that transport. Do not change agent permission settings.

Run retrieval, package setup and background indexing on the controller, outside the
reserved benchmark runner. Do not add MCP activity to a frozen timing/profile phase.
New advice cannot change already preregistered source, seeds, cases, thresholds or
retry rules; document a separate future experiment when a change is needed.

The MCP supplies source retrieval, interpretation aids and evidence checks. It does
not replace actual profiles, correctness, qualified A/A and ABBA, independent
confirmation or adversarial review. Its bundled benchmark numbers are measurements
on their stated machine and must never qualify our ARM, Intel, AMD or Apple results.
Preserve disagreements and unsupported explanations; selecting NONE remains valid.

## Shared entry points and reference

Codex reads the rule in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Claude reads the same rule through
[.claude/CLAUDE.md](../.claude/CLAUDE.md), which imports AGENTS.md. Keep this workflow
backend-neutral and in Git so new checkouts and worktrees receive it.

The authoritative tool catalog and connection instructions are in the project's
[MCP README](https://github.com/usamahz/cpu-performance-engineering/blob/main/misc/mcp/README.md).
Tool names above were checked on19 October2026. Discover the actual exposed schema
rather than guessing arguments. Keep connection credentials, downloaded libraries
and copyrighted source bodies out of this public repository; commit requests,
concise findings, links and appropriate hashes instead.
